# MATLAB MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)-not recommended

A simple, low level, unfinished implementation of the MLP type Neural Network algorithm with gradient descent. <br>
This code is NOT recommended for general, straightforward usage. Matlab comes with a much more efficient MLP implementation.

This code is useful for understanding the MLP algorithm, as well as a basis for creating your own specially designed (low-level) MLP.

DISCLAIMER: There are implementation (<-> syntax) errors left, please take heed. (Errors that won't cause runtime breakdown yet create a false implementation of the algorithm). <br>
COPYRIGHT: None at all, please feel free to use, change & share however you like.
